Simple, real-time chat application using mongodb and sockets.io.

This application is based on a tutorial by Traversy Media: https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb . I will be adding my own improvements to the app while I continue to learn mongodb and sockets

### Install
npm install - get the mongodb driver and sockets.io modules

### Run
npm start - run node
